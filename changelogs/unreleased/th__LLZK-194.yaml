  - FlatteningPass 'cleanup' option to specify how aggressively structs should be removed
  - SymbolDefTree analysis - node for each Symbol where the parent is the defining SymbolTable
  - SymbolUseGraph analysis - node for each Symbol/SymbolRefAttr where predecessors are Symbol Ops that *use* the Symbol within
fixed:
